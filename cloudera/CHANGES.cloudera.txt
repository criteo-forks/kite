    KITE-991: Fix Parquet file size estimate.
    
    This fixes size-based rolling for Parquet files and enables the test.
    Size-based rolling was previously not working because it wasn't possible
    to get the buffered size of a Parquet file. PARQUET-308 exposes an
    accessor, which is now available after the update to 1.8.1.

    KITE-1083: Add warnings to POM files about Hive changes.
    
    This warns that the jars needed to connect to the metastore are pulled
    in individually and kite-tools should be checked when Hive dependencies
    change to avoid regressions.

    KITE-1083: Add single jars to DistCache for Hive.
    
    This changes the way jobs submitted by the CLI are configured.
    Previously, the entire lib directory for Hive was added to the
    distributed cache. This caused long job and task startup times and
    exposed some conflicting jar problems. This commit updates the setup so
    that individual jars are added for classes needed for interacting with
    the Hive MetaStore. In cases where the job is local or the job isn't
    interacting with Hive, this doesn't add Hive dependencies to the
    distributed cache at all.

    KITE-1079: Improve URI debugging with error messages.
    
    This adds a map to DynConstructor.Builder that keeps all of the reasons
    why classes weren't loaded. In the case where one is present but can't
    be loaded because a dependency is missing, it is obvious what needs to
    be added to the classpath.

    KITE-1076: Fix flaky Crunch-Hive test.
    
    The test fails in job setup using the local job runner when the HBase
    test has been run first. It appears to be a bug in the test runner code
    that can be avoided by not reusing test VMs for the Crunch module.

    local. This is no longer needed and is causing a different failure.

    KITE-1057: Fix signal path for single data file.
    
    The CLI will create a dataset around a single data file, but the
    FileSystemDataset code assumed that the path it uses is a directory.
    This caused errors because the signal manager attempted to use the
    incoming data file path as a directory that potentially contained the
    signals folder. This updates the FileSystemDataset to use the data
    file's parent for the signal path.

    KITE-1023: Avoid using new Path(URI), add warnings.
    
    This adds warnings for methods that may return URIs that are FS paths to
    prevent users from calling new Path(URI). It also removes incorrect use
    of new Path(URI) from Kite's FS implementation.

    KITE-1023: Fix PartitionView URI escaping.
    
    This adds test for URIs with escaped characters and fixes handling in
    the FS PartitionView implementation. The implementation was accidentally
    unescaping URIs by using URI.create, which expects escaped characters,
    along with URI#getPath, which will remove escapes.
    
    This also fixes the URI returned by getLocation. This previously used
    Path#getUri, but that method returns the Path's internal URI that
    is double-escaped. Returning a URI created from Path#toString is the
    correct behavior because it matches the Path passed in. Similarly,
    the merge and replace methods in the FS dataset implementation that rely
    on Paths created from those locations have been updated to correctly
    construct a Path from a URI by converting the URI to a String rather
    than setting the internal URI directly.

    safe to share because they are thread-safe.

    KITE-991: Add SPI calls to set roll configuration.
    
    This adds RollingWriter to the SPI, which adds setRollIntervalMillis and
    setTargetFileSize methods. The partitioned writer and file writer now
    implement this to allow callers to check whether the writer is a rolling
    writer and configure rolling without setting descriptor properties.
    
    The descriptor properties are used to initialize the roll interval and
    target file size, but are overridden by the setter methods.

    KITE-991: Add size-based and time-based file rolling.
    
    File size-based rolling works and is passing a new test for Avro, but is
    disabled for Parquet because the appender has no reliable size estimate
    for Parquet.
    
    Time-based rolling uses a new SPI interface, ClockReady, which exposes a
    method for passing time signals to implementing classes. This removes
    the need for Kite to provide a thread-based check.

    It appears that this was working around PARQUET-62, which fixed

    CDK-1016: Fix OutputFormat writing directly to datasets.
    
    This happens only when a dataset instance is passed to the configuration

    inspecting whether the partition key has any values.

    CDK-973: Fix tests after rebase.
    
    The copy command tests were writing to 5 partitions but expecting 6
    files. This was caused by the writer cache getting rid of one of the
    writers before finishing. The solution is to set the writer cache size
    when creating the dataset to avoid inconsistent behavior.

    CDK-976: Fix test failures caused by default conf changes.
    
    The default conf needs to be set in MR tasks, but always setting the
    configuration in InputFormat and OutputFormat messages isn't correct
    because the methods aren't necessarily called in a new process. Using
    those methods within a test process, for example, broke several CLI
    tests because the DefaultConfiguration is shared.
    
    This fixes the problem by adding an init method to DefaultConfiguration
    that will set the default conf if it has not already been set. The set
    method will always set the conf and prevents init from setting it later.

        Constraints and Predicates have a few updates made to be able to request normalized
        forms
    
        MapReduce updated to create these signals when possible when a write to a dataset
        is successful. Crunch updated to support using these signals for WriteMode.CHECKPOINT
        (with a 'ready' view essentially indicating a previous success)

    CDK-898: Fix file not found bug in distributed cache.
    
    Setup in the distributed cache is failing when using the local job
    runner when HDFS is the default file system. This is very likely related
    to HDFS-7031. The work-around is to set the local FS as the default when
    using LocalJobRunner. This is safe because HDFS has already been loaded,
    so lookups without the authority with still resolve to the full URI.

    Speed up schema migration when loading all schemas from a directory
    
    The following changes are made
    1. kicking off HbaseAdmin.createTableAsync for a bunch of tables and waiting for HBaseAdmin.isTableAvailable for all the tables is much quicker. The SchemaTool waits for a maximum of 10 minutes for all the tables to become available which seems like a very legible buffer.
    2. HBaseAdmin.disableTable and HBaseAdmin.enableTable are very costly (~25% time spent over the schema migration). Instead of creating tables as and when we know about a entity schema, construct the HTableDescriptor for all the entity schemas for a specific table, this was we dont have to add column families at a later point of time which requires the disable and enable

    CDK-615: Permissions issue writing to a partitioned Hive external dataset
    
    * This patch reverses course from the previous one. Depending on the
      dataset implementation, you may or may not want Kite creating the
      directories.
    * This patch moves the partitionAdded callback to happen before new
      partition directories are created to give the listener a chance
      to create them in Kite or externally.
    * In particular, external Hive datasets will create the directories on
      the Kite side while managed Hive datasets will let the Hive metastore
      create them.
    * This doesn't affect file system datasets as they don't have listeners
      regisitered unless they're manulaly created with a custom
      MetadataProvider
    * Added a test of `load()` methods of `DatasetWriterCacheLoader` and
      `IncrementalDatasetWriterCacheLoader`.
    * Fixed a typo

    Wrap is almost identical to create, but fills in missing values when

    This also ensures that any datasets created with the CLI are valid for

    KITE-1053: Fix int overflow bug in FS writer.
    
    Keeping the number of records written in an int caused a bug where
    writing more than Integer.MAX_VALUE records (~2B) would overflow the
    counter and the check to see whether any records had been written would
    fail because count is less than 0. The fix is to use a long.

    CDK-945: Ignore trailing slash in URIs.
    
    This updates the URIPattern code to ignore trailing slashes in URIs.
    URIs can still match a trailing / explicitly, and URI pattern globbing
    still works as before.

    CDK-955: Fix duplicate URIs from Datasets.list.
    
    The problem was that the FileSystem implementation was returning
    multiple "default" namespaces. The implementation now uses a Set to
    accumulate both namespaces and dataset names.
    
    The bug only happened when a repository namespace path was used instead
    of a repository. In that case, the single namespace appears to be a
    valid repository with tables in the default namespace. Each table in the
    default namespace would result in another "default" in the list of
    namespaces. When Datasets.list listed the tables in each namespace, all
    of the tables were present in each copy of default, which resulted in
    n^2 results.

    CLOUDERA-BUILD. Update POM files for CDH.
    
    Most updates are setting the version to 1.0.0-cdh5.4.0-SNAPSHOT.
    
    The project compiles.
    
    Root pom updates:
    * Use CDH root pom for 5.4.0-SNAPSHOT
    * Remove all non-standard properties
    * Add -base properties for javadoc links
    * Use -cdh5 dependency aggregator artifacts
    * Remove unused dependency profiles, but not cdh5
      (cdh5 may be used by build processes)
    * Update cdh5 profile to match default deps
    * Remove cloudera releases repo
    * Remove Sonatype distributionManagement
    
    Minicluster updates:
    * Use different factory method for Hive metastore server
    * Add test aggregator deps with compile scope (MiniHBaseCluster
      is missing otherwise)
    
    Other updates:
    * Remove the parquet-hive bundle dep, this is part of Hive in CDH
    * Remove non-CDH5 dependency aggregators for HDFS and HBase
    * Remove all alternate (e.g., *-cdh5) version properties
